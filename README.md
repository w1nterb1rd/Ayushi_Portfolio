## [Machine Learning assignments] <br>
These include projects I did to learn concepts of Machine Learning using Python.

## [Python assignments](https://github.com/w1nterb1rd/Python-Assignments) <br>
This section consists of assignments about using Python for data science. This includes:-
 * Scrapping data from webpages using BeautifulSoup library
 * Parsing tables from PDFs using tabula
 * Summarazing the data using Pandas profiling

## [Project: Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/w1nterb1rd/Heart-Disease-Prediction)
<p align=justify>The data was taken from Kaggle. Based on age, gender and symptoms of a person, the model predicts if that person is likely to have a heart attack or not. Since the dependent variable is categorical in nature, logistic regression model has been used. In this project, I have done step by step cleaning of data, treatment of outliers, dividing the data into test and train, modelling and accuracy check. Depending on the correlation between the independent variables, three models have been compared.</p>

## [Mini Projects](https://github.com/w1nterb1rd/Mini-Projects)

 These are some of the analytics projects I did using R. Data was taken from Kaggle.
 
 * Boston Housing - Linear regression.
 * Credit card fraud detection - Logistic Regression and Random Forest
 * Candy Production -  Time series analysis and forecasting
